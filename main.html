	<p>Here is a bio section that totally describes who I am.  It is actually a few paragraphs and over 300 words long!</p>

	<p>Despite the fact that I initially knew very little about programming and computers in general, I really want to be a computer engineer.  I was previously a pharmacy student but left pharmacy school 
	because I did not like what I was learning, and I did not like learning in an environment in which the most difficult mathematical knowledge required was basic algebra.  
	I wanted something more mentally engaging, and with so many non&#45;pharmacy interests, a curriculum focused solely upon the inculcation of pharmacy knowledge 
	was a real tedium for me.  After having known so many computer nerds and a few actual (i.e. non&#45;student) computer engineers and seeing what they do, I realized that 
	computer engineering might be a much better fit for me; taking a programming class confirmed that. Now, I am actually a super senior, but in terms of academic progress I am 
	a ridiculously old junior..</p>	

	<p>My parents didn&#39;t like the idea of me becoming an engineer. <br />"But&#45;but&#45;but pharmacy is such a good career for girls!" my mother said, "which is why I
	decided that you should become a pharmacist when you were too young to make that decision for yourself!" <br />  
	"Engineering is for boys!" my father said.  <br />
	"Those men are going to push you around and abuse you!" they said. </p>

	<p>And then I moved out despite the fact that I have absolutely no money because dying of starvation is completely worth not spending the rest of my life
	as a self&#45;loathing pharmacist.  For a while, I had to subsist on mostly potatoes, onions, and bananas until I could find a job, which was difficult because I had no
	non-pharmacy skills and could no longer work as a pharmacy intern.</p>		

	<p>My grandparents rise from the dead every All Hallows' Eve to feed candy to all my friends.  The pattern of growth of Romanesco broccoli is nothing like a fractal at all.
	Unicorns live in my navel.  Spending too much time on Reddit is always fun.  None of this paragraph is true. 
	
	<p>I like cats and lattes. </p>

	<p>I have terrible humor.</p>
